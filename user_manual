User Manual: Contact Data Generator and Storage
***************************************************

Overview

This program generates fake contact data and writes it to a specified destination. It currently supports writing to
a CSV file, MySQL database, or PostgreSQL database. The number of contacts, output type, and probabilities of
generating specific pieces of data are all configurable.

***************************************************

Prerequisites

Python 3.7 or above
Required Python libraries: faker, mysql.connector, psycopg2
Access to a MySQL or PostgreSQL database (if writing to a database)

***************************************************

Configuration

The program's behavior is configured through an INI-style configuration file, which must have the following sections:

[main]: Contains the main configuration options.

db_type: Specifies the output destination. Valid values are 'csv', 'mysql', and 'postgresql'.
number_of_contacts: The number of contacts to generate.

[probabilities]: Specifies the probabilities of generating optional pieces of contact data. Expected format is a series
of key-value pairs separated by commas, like key1=value1,key2=value2,....

[database] (optional): Contains database connection parameters. This section is required when db_type is
either 'mysql' or 'postgresql'. The parameters include:

host: The database server host.
port: The port number to use when connecting to the database server.
user: The username to use for authenticating with the database.
password: The password to use for authenticating with the database.
database: The name of the database to use.

***************************************************

Running the Program

Make sure you have installed the necessary Python libraries. You can install them with pip:
pip install faker mysql-connector-python psycopg2

Prepare your configuration file based on the format described above.

Run the program from the command line with your configuration file as the argument:
python main.py /path/to/your/config.ini

***************************************************

Output

The program will generate contact data based on the provided configuration and write it to the specified output
destination. If the output destination is a CSV file, the program will create the file in the current directory
and print the name of the file to the console. If the output destination is a database, the program will create
a new table in the database and insert the generated data into that table, then print the name of the created
table to the console.
